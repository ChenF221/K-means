# K-means
This Python script performs K-Means clustering on soccer team data using the scikit-learn library and then visualizes the clustering results using Matplotlib.

This Python script utilizes the pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries to conduct K-Means clustering analysis on soccer team data. Beginning with data loading, it imports a dataset from a CSV file named "p9_team_data.csv" using pandas, extracting the 'off' (goals scored per game) and 'def' (goals lost per game) features. After prompting the user to input the desired number of clusters (k), it initializes a KMeans model from scikit-learn with the specified k value and fits it to the data, obtaining cluster centroids and labels. The script then visualizes the clustering results using Matplotlib, generating a scatter plot where each data point is colored according to its cluster label, and centroids are marked distinctly. The x-axis represents goals scored per game, the y-axis indicates goals lost per game, and the plot is titled "K-Means Clustering Goal scored vs Goal losted." Finally, it appends a new column to the DataFrame with cluster labels and saves the modified DataFrame to a new CSV file named "p9_team_data_agrup.csv". This script offers a straightforward implementation of K-Means clustering for soccer team data analysis, encompassing data preprocessing, clustering, visualization, and result exportation.
